- **Identified Threats**:
  - Unwanted inflation -> **cap**.
  - Compromised admin key -> **multisig**.
  - Integration/bridge incident -> **pause**.
  - Tokens lost on the contract -> **rescue** (except FT42).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Isolate the deployment key (test wallet).
  - Owner rotation -> `transferOwnership`.
  - No non-standard logic on `transfer` (avoids "tax tokens" and edge cases).
  - Verified OZ dependencies, version pin-locked in CI (package-lock).
